# Tool Calling Contract

This proxy translates OpenAI-compatible tool calls to/from M365 Copilot. Because M365 doesn't natively support the OpenAI tool-calling protocol, we prompt-engineer it via a system prompt and enforce the contract at the proxy layer.

## Output Contract

Tool calls are **fenced** (Markdown code blocks) — the JSON `{"tool":...}` format
was removed (it scored 0/5 on real agentic tasks; see [hypotheses §9](./hypotheses.md)).
A tool call is a code fence whose info-string is the tool name:

```
` ``read_file
/etc/hostname
` ``
```

Per-tool shape: the fence info-string is the tool name, scalar args are `key: value`
header lines, one free-form arg is the fence body, and an `old`/`new` pair renders as an
aider-style `SEARCH/REPLACE` diff.

**Shell-routing (the load-bearing trick).** M365's chat model won't "act as an agent" on
demand but *will* reflexively write a ` ```bash ` block. When the toolset includes a shell
tool (`bash`/`shell`/`run`/`run_command`/… — any name), the proxy injects "do the whole step
by writing one ` ```bash ` block" framing and routes that block to the shell tool. This is
what turns 0/5 into real multi-turn loops. See [hypotheses §9 F12](./hypotheses.md).

## Enforcement

The contract is enforced at three layers:

### 1. System Prompt (packages/core/src/tools.ts)

`formatFencedToolDefinitions()` injects the contract into every tool-enabled request:
- "Performing the task with tools is your **PRIMARY JOB**. Answering the user in prose is, and always will be, SECONDARY."
- A fenced block is an **ACTION the runtime executes**, not an example/illustration.
- **Shell-first framing** when a shell tool is present: "do the whole step by writing ONE ` ```bash ` block" (heredocs to create, `sed` to edit, `cat`/`ls`/`grep` to inspect), plus **anti-confabulation** ("you've run nothing yet — never claim commands return no output; your FIRST output is a ` ```bash ` block"). This framing is what made it work through real pi (hypotheses §9 F14).
- "**Never claim success** (`✅`/`SUCCESS`/`Done`) unless a `<tool_response>` proving it already appears above" — M365 loves to declare victory before the build runs.
- "When you do give the final answer, **no preamble/sign-off**".

### 2. Copilot Studio Agent System Prompt (packages/core/src/agent.ts)

The most important layer: an auto-created Copilot Studio agent carries tool-calling
instructions in its **server-side** system prompt. Without the agent, M365 ignores the
per-request injection and answers in prose (or hallucinates). See
[m365-copilot-api.md](./m365-copilot-api.md) for why.

These instructions are baked in at agent-creation time and can't be cheaply updated in
place, so the agent is **versioned by name**: it's called `m365-tool-agent-<hash>`, where
`<hash>` is a short SHA-256 of the current instructions. Editing `getAgentInstructions()`
changes the hash, so the next request provisions a fresh agent; old versions are **never
deleted** (multi-host safety — a second proxy may still be using one). Hosts sharing a tenant
compute the same name for the same instructions and converge on one agent with no coordination.

### 3. Behaviour-hardening layer (packages/proxy-lib/src/handler.ts, tools.ts)

The model's output is scrubbed and steered at the proxy regardless of whether it obeyed
the prompt — the durable lever, since M365's chat-RLHF leaks through no matter how the
prompt is tuned. The layers, in handler order:

- **Document guard** (`isProseDocument`): shell-routing turns *every* ` ```bash ` block into
  a tool call — so a model that ANSWERS with a markdown document full of code fences (e.g.
  "here's a simplified README") would get its own answer executed as shell. A response that
  looks like a document (≥2 fences AND ≥120 chars surrounding prose, OR ≥4 fences) is returned
  as **text**, not executed. A single action is never reclassified. (hypotheses §9 F15.)
- **Confabulation retry** (`looksLikeConfabulation`): if a tool request comes back with no
  tool call and give-up prose ("can't access the files", "commands return no output", "the
  file appears empty", "paste the files"), the proxy re-prompts forcefully **in the same
  conversation** to force a real first action. `M365_NO_CONFAB_RETRY` / `M365_CONFAB_RETRIES`.
- **Hallucinated-completion retry** (`looksLikeHallucinatedCompletion`): if the model CLAIMS
  a file mutation ("I've replaced the README") with **no tool call all conversation**, force a
  real write. Gated on "never acted," so it won't misfire on a genuine post-write summary.
- **Tool-result labelling:** each `<tool_response>` is tagged with the command that produced
  it (`<tool_response tool="bash" command="ls -la">`) by correlating `tool_call_id` back to
  the call — so the model reads output in context (a listing vs file contents vs stdout)
  instead of e.g. misreading an `ls` result as an empty file. (hypotheses §9 F16.)
- **Mixed output:** when a response has tool calls AND extra text, the text is **stripped**;
  the client gets only `tool_calls` with `content: null` (stripped text is logged).
- **Invented JSON:** `parseToolCalls()` removes `{"confidence":N}`, **drops** a `{"final":…}`
  riding alongside tool calls (premature success), and **unwraps** a lone `{"final":"…"}`.
- **Batched tool calls (default):** M365 may batch several tool calls into one
  response; they execute sequentially client-side, each seeing the previous
  `tool_response`. Restore strict one-call-per-turn with `M365_NO_MULTI_TOOL=1`.
- **Empty ≠ rate limit:** an empty reply is treated as throttling only when the throttle is
  **at-limit**; otherwise it fails fast after a couple of quick retries. Repeated empties
  across **distinct conversations** (the thread-rate-throttle signature) trigger **degradation
  backoff** — the proxy paces subsequent turns so the account self-heals. This replaced the
  old auto-reauth: a fresh login does **not** clear this throttle (`oid`-keyed — hypotheses
  §11 H-R1) and raised our detection profile. `M365_NO_BACKOFF` to disable.

> The JSON tool format and the few-shot block were **removed** this cycle (0/5 on real
> agentic tasks). Tool calling is fenced-only; behavioural framing lives in the per-request
> `<tools>` block, not a baked-in few-shot.
