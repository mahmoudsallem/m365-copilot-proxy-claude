# m365-copilot-proxy

Use an eligible Microsoft 365 work or university account as a local LLM backend for
Claude Code, [pi](https://pi.dev/), [OpenClaw](https://docs.openclaw.ai/), and other
OpenAI-compatible clients. The proxy translates M365 Copilot's WebSocket/SignalR
protocol into OpenAI and Anthropic-compatible localhost APIs with agent tool support.

> [!WARNING]
> This is an independent, unofficial compatibility project built on an undocumented
> Microsoft endpoint. It can stop working when Microsoft changes the service. Confirm
> that your account and tenant policies allow this use. Keep the proxy on
> `127.0.0.1`; never publish its port or bearer key.

> **Want the gory protocol details?** See [docs/m365-copilot-api.md](docs/m365-copilot-api.md) — a full write-up of M365 Copilot's undocumented WebSocket API: auth, SignalR frames, tones/models, throttling, the "Disengaged" filter, and the Copilot Studio agent trick that makes tool calling work.

## How it works

M365 Copilot uses a SignalR WebSocket protocol, not the OpenAI API. This project translates between the two:

1. **Standalone proxy** — HTTP server with `/v1/chat/completions` and `/v1/models` endpoints. Works with any OpenAI-compatible client (pi, OpenClaw, etc.).
2. **OpenClaw plugin** — Config generator + setup CLI for OpenClaw's provider system.

### Tool calling

M365 Copilot doesn't support OpenAI-style `tool_calls` natively. Instead, tools are
emulated via a **Markdown-fence format** (the JSON `{"tool":...}` format was removed —
it scored 0/5 on real agentic tasks; see [hypotheses §9](docs/hypotheses.md)):

- Tool definitions are injected into the prompt as fenced templates inside a `<tools>` block
- The model emits a fenced tool call — a code block whose info-string is the tool name
  (scalar args as `key: value` header lines, one free-form body arg as the fence body,
  `old`/`new` edits as aider-style `SEARCH/REPLACE` diffs)
- The proxy/handler parses that and converts it to OpenAI `tool_calls` format
- **Shell-routing (the key lever):** M365's chat-tuned model won't "act as an agent" on
  demand but *will* reflexively write a ```` ```bash ```` block. When the toolset includes a
  shell tool (`bash`/`shell`/`run`/`run_command`/… — any name), the proxy injects "do the
  whole step by writing one ```` ```bash ```` block" framing and routes that block to the
  shell tool. This exploits the one agentic behavior Microsoft's system prompt permits, and
  is what turns 0/5 into real multi-turn loops (verified 9-tool-call bug fix).
- **Reliability comes from the Copilot Studio agent (below) + the fenced/shell framing** —
  without the agent, M365 ignores tool instructions and answers in prose

### Agent mode

On first use, the system creates a **Copilot Studio agent** with tool-calling instructions baked into its server-side system prompt. This is done via the PowerPlatform API:

1. Discovers the environment URL via the BAP API (`api.bap.microsoft.com`)
2. Creates a bot with instructions in the Copilot Studio `minimalBots` API
3. Publishes the bot to get a `TitleId`
4. Uses the agent ID (`T_{titleId}.{botId}.gpt.default`) in WebSocket chat requests
5. Caches the agent ID in `~/.config/opencode-m365/agent-id.json`

### Conversation reuse

Each agent session reuses the same M365 conversation (same `sessionId` + `conversationId`). The WebSocket reconnects per turn but M365 maintains server-side context. This saves quota — the 600 message limit applies per-conversation.

## Packages

```
@m365-copilot/core          — Shared: auth, WebSocket client, tool formatting, proxy server, agent management, session
├── @m365-copilot/proxy     — Standalone HTTP proxy binary
└── @m365-copilot/openclaw-plugin  — OpenClaw config generator + setup CLI + skill
```

## One-click Linux setup

### Requirements

- 64-bit Linux with Bash
- `npm`, `curl`, and Git (Git is unnecessary when using a downloaded archive)
- An eligible Microsoft 365 work or university account with Copilot Chat access
- A Chromium-based browser for the recommended interactive sign-in
- Claude Code, only if you want to use the Claude terminal interface

The installer downloads a private Node.js 24 runtime into this repository's `.runtime/`
directory. It does not replace the system Node.js and it installs locked dependency
versions from `pnpm-lock.yaml`.

### Fast path

Clone the private repository or download and extract its archive, then run:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/Arkedia-develipment/m365-copilot-proxy.git
cd m365-copilot-proxy

./install.sh
./login.sh
./start-proxy.sh
./connect-claude.sh
claude
```

If an extracted archive lost executable permissions, use `bash install.sh`,
`bash login.sh`, and so on. Installation also adds the `m365-copilot` command under
`~/.local/bin`.

### Included executable files

| File | Purpose |
|---|---|
| `install.sh` | Install the private runtime, locked dependencies, build, and command |
| `login.sh` | Open the safe interactive Microsoft login |
| `login-device-code.sh` | Try Microsoft's device-code login on another trusted device |
| `start-proxy.sh` | Start the proxy in the background and verify its health |
| `stop-proxy.sh` | Stop only the proxy process managed by this installation |
| `proxy-status.sh` | Show proxy health, PID, configuration, log, and Claude mode |
| `connect-claude.sh` | Make plain `claude` use M365; preserve the original executable |
| `disconnect-claude.sh` | Restore normal Anthropic Claude exactly |
| `doctor.sh` | Diagnose dependencies, login state, proxy health, and Claude mode |
| `uninstall.sh` | Remove launchers while preserving login data by default |

Every action is also available through one command:

```bash
m365-copilot help
m365-copilot login
m365-copilot start
m365-copilot status
m365-copilot models
m365-copilot logs --follow
m365-copilot connect-claude
m365-copilot disconnect-claude
```

### Sign in safely

`login.sh` opens a visible Microsoft browser. Enter the address, password, and MFA only
on Microsoft's page. The proxy captures a short-lived OAuth authorization code and stores
an MSAL refresh cache at `~/.config/opencode-m365/msal-cache.json`; it never requests or
stores the password or MFA seed.

If interactive login is unavailable, `login-device-code.sh` prints Microsoft's URL and a
short-lived code. Do not paste that code into chat or store it in a file. Error `53003`
means the university's Conditional Access policy rejected that device, platform, or auth
flow. The launcher cannot bypass it; use the interactive browser flow or ask the tenant
administrator.

### Start and manage the proxy

The proxy runs in the background on `http://127.0.0.1:4141`:

```bash
m365-copilot start
m365-copilot status
m365-copilot models
m365-copilot logs --follow
m365-copilot stop
```

The manager records an exact PID and refuses to kill an unrelated process. Runtime files:

- private API key: `~/.config/m365-copilot-proxy/proxy.env` (mode `0600`)
- proxy PID and log: `~/.local/state/m365-copilot-proxy/`
- Microsoft token cache: `~/.config/opencode-m365/msal-cache.json`

The read-only model catalog can be opened at `http://127.0.0.1:4141/v1/models`.
All model-consuming endpoints require the generated local bearer key.

### Connect and disconnect Claude Code

Connection is reversible. `connect-claude.sh` preserves the currently resolved Claude
executable and installs a small wrapper at `~/.local/bin/claude`. It does not overwrite
Claude's subscription credentials. It also installs `claude-direct`, which bypasses M365
without disconnecting:

```bash
m365-copilot connect-claude
m365-copilot start

claude                         # M365-backed Claude Code interface
MODEL=quick claude             # faster M365 model
MODEL=gpt-5.5-think-deeper claude
claude-direct                  # original Anthropic provider

m365-copilot disconnect-claude # restore normal `claude`
```

Claude's `/model` picker contains Anthropic product names rather than the M365 catalog.
Unsupported choices are mapped to `gpt-5.5-think-deeper`; selecting “Opus” does not grant
an Anthropic Opus model. Use `MODEL=<id> claude` for an explicit M365 model.

The wrapper intentionally exposes only `Bash`, `Read`, `Edit`, `Write`, `Glob`, and
`Grep`. Larger tool schemas frequently trigger M365's content filter. Treat every command
as untrusted: keep Claude permissions enabled, inspect diffs, and run tests before commits.

### Other clients

Pi in a selected bubblewrap workspace:

```bash
bash scripts/pi-sandbox.sh /absolute/path/to/project
```

OpenClaw:

```bash
m365-openclaw-setup
```

Any OpenAI-compatible client can use `http://127.0.0.1:4141/v1` with the bearer key in
`~/.config/m365-copilot-proxy/proxy.env`. Anthropic Messages-compatible clients can use
`http://127.0.0.1:4141/v1/messages`.

### Troubleshooting

Run `m365-copilot doctor` first. Common cases:

- **`EADDRINUSE :4141`** — another proxy/process owns the port. Stop its terminal or run
  the existing instance; the manager will not kill an unrecognized process.
- **Connection error in Claude** — run `m365-copilot status`, then
  `m365-copilot start`.
- **Empty response / `Disengaged`** — do not retry rapidly. Large prompts, large tool
  payloads, or account-level throttling can cause empty replies. Wait, then continue one
  conversation rather than opening many new ones.
- **`Both ANTHROPIC_AUTH_TOKEN and apiKeyHelper set`** — reconnect once with
  `m365-copilot connect-claude`; it safely removes legacy localhost proxy fields while
  backing up the prior Claude settings.
- **Return to paid/normal Claude immediately** — run `claude-direct`, or permanently run
  `m365-copilot disconnect-claude`.

### Uninstall

```bash
./uninstall.sh
./uninstall.sh --purge
```

The default removes the command wrappers and restores Claude while keeping configuration,
logs, and Microsoft login state. `--purge` additionally removes this proxy's configuration
and logs, but intentionally preserves the Microsoft token cache. The downloaded repository
and `.runtime/` remain until you delete that exact folder yourself.

## Available models

| Model ID | M365 Tone | Description |
|---|---|---|
| `gpt-5.5-think-deeper` | Gpt_5_5_Reasoning | **Recommended default for agents/tool-calling** — robust tool compliance |
| `gpt-5.5` / `gpt-5.5-quick` | Gpt_5_5_Chat | GPT-5.5 fast |
| `m365-copilot` / `auto` | magic | Auto-routing — high-variance at tool-calling (confabulates; see below) |
| `quick` | Gpt_Quick | Fast responses |
| `think-deeper` | Gpt_Reasoning | Slower, more thorough |
| `claude` / `claude-sonnet` | Claude_Sonnet | Real Anthropic Claude (agent-less path) |
| `claude-sonnet-think-deeper` | Claude_Sonnet_Reasoning | Claude reasoning |
| `gpt-5.4` / `gpt-5.4-quick` | Gpt_5_4_* | GPT-5.4 |
| `gpt-5.3` / `gpt-5.3-think-deeper` | Gpt_5_3_* | GPT-5.3 |
| `gpt-5.2` / `gpt-5.2-think-deeper` | Gpt_5_2_* | GPT-5.2 |

> ✅ **For tool calling, use `gpt-5.5-think-deeper` (the default when no model is sent).**
> The current agent + fenced/shell-routing path makes this reasoning tone robust —
> 100% compliance and solve across prompt/toolset sizes on the bench (docs/hypotheses.md
> §12.10/§12.11). The **default `m365-copilot` (magic) tone is *not* reliable** for
> tools — it confabulates ("I no longer have access to the filesystem tools") and solves
> ~0% of real tasks (§12.11); a proxy request with no `model` field already defaults to
> `gpt-5.5-think-deeper` for this reason.
>
> ⚠️ The **older** reasoning tones (`gpt-5.2`/`gpt-5.3`/`gpt-5.4` `*-think-deeper`, bare
> `think-deeper`) route through M365's `DeepLeo` pipeline, which meta-analyzes the
> injected prompt and can disengage from tools. Prefer `gpt-5.5-think-deeper`.

## Image generation

M365 Copilot generates images through a built-in server-side tool, and the core
package exposes it as one call. The picture comes back on a `GraphicArt` frame as
a URL (never as chat text), and the bytes sit behind a separate auth boundary —
`generateImage()` handles both, returning the image with bytes attached:

```ts
import { generateImage } from "@m365-copilot/core";

const [img] = await generateImage("A minimalist flat-design logo of a lighthouse, teal and white.");
// img.data      -> Buffer (real PNG, verified end-to-end)
// img.base64    -> same bytes, ready for an OpenAI-style b64_json response
// img.contentType, img.size, img.orientation
```

Everything the M365 web client can do is reachable — the proxy sends the same image
optionsSets it does. Steer type and aspect with options (they nudge the prompt the
way the GUI's meta-prompting does; the model still makes the final call):

```ts
await generateImage("a lighthouse on a cliff", { orientation: "portrait" });   // landscape | portrait | square
await generateImage("a lighthouse", { style: "icon" });                        // natural | icon | story | designer
```

**You don't have to call `generateImage` at all.** Just like the web client, a plain
chat turn draws when asked — send `"draw me an image of a green teapot"` to
`/v1/chat/completions` (or `ModelSession.run`) with no tools and the image comes back
embedded in the reply as a markdown data-URI. (Image gen is enabled on the agent-less
path only, so it never competes with tool calling; set `M365_NO_IMAGE_GEN=1` to force
pure text.)

Runs its own agent-less session. Uses the same login as chat; the artifact fetch uses
a `designerappservice` token acquired silently from the existing cache. Protocol
write-up: [docs/hypotheses.md §14](docs/hypotheses.md).

> **Separate, scarcer budget.** Image generation draws on its own daily quota, distinct
> from the ~600-message conversation limit and not metered by the chat throttle — treat
> image calls as the expensive ones. When it's exhausted, `generateImage()` throws
> `ImageGenerationError` with `reason: "quota_exceeded"` (map it to HTTP 429); a plain
> chat turn instead returns M365's "can't generate any more images today" message as text.

An OpenAI-compatible `POST /v1/images/generations` endpoint on top of this is the
next step — the core API it needs is already in place.

## Authentication

The auth flow uses Azure MSAL with PKCE:

1. **Silent refresh** — Uses cached tokens from `~/.config/opencode-m365/msal-cache.json`
2. **Interactive login** — Opens a visible browser; the user completes Microsoft's
   sign-in and MFA directly, with no password or MFA secret stored by the proxy
3. **Device-code login** — Displays a short-lived Microsoft device code for completion
   on another trusted browser/device; useful for CLI and broker-oriented accounts
4. **Legacy automated login** — Available only when an operator deliberately supplies
   the older `secrets.json`; it is not used by the local launcher

Three token scopes are acquired:
- `substrate.office.com/sydney/*` — For M365 Copilot chat
- `api.powerplatform.com/.default` — For Copilot Studio agent management
- `api.bap.microsoft.com/.default` — For environment discovery

## Environment variables

| Variable | Description |
|---|---|
| `M365_DEBUG` | Set to `1` to enable debug logging to `~/.config/opencode-m365/debug.log` (truncated payloads) |
| `M365_TRACE` | Set to `1` for full, untruncated debug logging (every WS frame/prompt/response) — implies `M365_DEBUG`. For reverse engineering. |
| `M365_LOG_STDOUT` | Set to `1` to mirror debug lines to the proxy's stdout as well as the log file, so you can watch a run without tailing it in a second terminal. Needs `M365_DEBUG` or `M365_TRACE` — on its own it logs nothing. |
| `M365_DUMP_FRAMES` | Set to `1` to write every WebSocket frame (both directions) to `~/.config/opencode-m365/frames/<requestId>.ndjson`. For offline diffing of new M365 fields. |
| `M365_ALLOW_MULTI_TOOL` | Allow the model to emit multiple tool calls per turn (default: only the first is kept) |
| `M365_INJECT_REPLY_TOOL` | Set to `1` to inject a synthetic `reply(text)` tool. Forces every turn to be a tool call, including pure-prose answers. Cleaner contract for the model, +1 tool to the prompt (watch the Disengaged threshold). Confirmed 5/5 compliance on June 9 2026 ([hypotheses §1.1](docs/hypotheses.md)). |
| `M365_NO_CONFAB_RETRY` / `M365_CONFAB_RETRIES` | M365's chat model sometimes produces prose instead of a tool call when it should act — either confabulating an inability ("I can't access the files, please paste them") **or** claiming a completion it never did ("I've replaced the README", with no tool call). On a first-turn refusal, the proxy now returns a safe read-only `bash` orientation call directly (when available), avoiding an extra M365 message; other detected cases are re-prompted forcefully **in the same conversation** (`M365_CONFAB_RETRIES`, default `1`). Set `M365_NO_CONFAB_RETRY=1` to disable recovery. |
| `M365_NO_BACKOFF` (alias `M365_NO_AUTO_REAUTH`) | Set to `1` to disable degradation backoff. By default, when empty/throttled responses span several **distinct conversations** in a short window (the thread-rate-throttle signature, [F13](docs/hypotheses.md)), the proxy **paces subsequent turns** (a jittered delay before starting new backend conversations) to let the account self-heal. This replaced the old auto-reauth: a fresh login does **not** clear this throttle (it's `oid`-keyed — [§11 H-R1](docs/hypotheses.md)) and raised our detection profile. A single long pi thread never trips the trigger. |
| `M365_BACKOFF_THRESHOLD` / `M365_BACKOFF_WINDOW_MS` / `M365_BACKOFF_BASE_MS` / `M365_BACKOFF_MAX_MS` | Tune backoff: distinct-conversation empties to trigger (default `3`), the window they must fall in (default `120000`), the initial pacing window (default `90000`), and its escalation cap (default `600000`). |
| `M365_BROWSER_PROFILE` / `M365_LOGIN_UA` | Override the persistent browser-profile dir and the login User-Agent used for the (rare) automated interactive login. The persistent profile keeps AAD SSO/device cookies so repeat logins are silent and look like a familiar device ([§11 H-R3](docs/hypotheses.md)). |
| `M365_CACHE_FILE` | Override MSAL token cache location |
| `M365_SECRETS_FILE` | Override credentials file location |
| `M365_INTERACTIVE_LOGIN` | Set to `1` to use visible browser sign-in when silent refresh is unavailable |
| `M365_PROXY_API_KEY` | Bearer key required by `/v1/*`; generated by `scripts/setup-local.sh` |
| `M365_REQUIRE_API_KEY` | Fail startup when the bearer key is absent; enabled by the local launcher |
| `M365_LOCAL_ENV` | Override the private local environment file used by the launch scripts |
| `CHROMIUM_PATH` | Path to Chromium binary for automated login |

### Usage / context-window % in responses

The OpenAI `usage` block in every chat completion response now includes M365
extension fields with the **per-conversation message quota** — the closest
proxy we have to "context-window utilisation" since M365 hides token counts:

```json
"usage": {
  "prompt_tokens": 0,
  "completion_tokens": 0,
  "total_tokens": 0,
  "x_m365_conversation_messages": 42,
  "x_m365_conversation_max": 600,
  "x_m365_conversation_pct": 7,
  "x_m365_conversation_remaining": 558,
  "x_m365_content_origin": "DeepLeo",
  "x_m365_message_type": null,
  "x_m365_turn_count": 3,
  "x_m365_classifier_scores": {
    "BotOffense": 1.27e-7,
    "dea_violation": 2.81e-6
  },
  "x_m365_dea_score": 2.81e-6,
  "x_m365_offense_score": 1.27e-7
}
```

`x_m365_dea_score` is M365's own "disengaged-eligible answer" classifier
score — the closest signal to "am I about to get Disengaged?". Empirically:
clean tool calls sit at ~1 × 10⁻⁸, prose at ~1 × 10⁻⁶, jailbreak-shaped
prompts at ~1 × 10⁻³. Disengaged itself fires at some threshold > 2 × 10⁻³
that we haven't yet pinpointed. Clients can monitor this to back off before
tripping the filter.

Clients that ignore unknown extension fields keep working; curious users can
read them. See [docs/hypotheses.md §0](docs/hypotheses.md) for the full
findings dump and [§2](docs/hypotheses.md) for what we tried and didn't find.

## Config files

Authentication state is stored in `~/.config/opencode-m365/`:

| File | Description |
|---|---|
| `msal-cache.json` | MSAL token cache (auto-managed) |
| `agent-id.json` | Cached Copilot Studio agent ID |
| `debug.log` | Debug log (when `M365_DEBUG=1`) |

The local proxy key is stored separately at
`~/.config/m365-copilot-proxy/proxy.env` (`0600`). Pi state is stored under
`~/.local/state/m365-copilot-proxy/pi-home/`. Neither location contains the Microsoft
password or an MFA seed.

## Development

```sh
bash scripts/local.sh install
bash scripts/local.sh build            # Build all packages
bash scripts/local.sh proxy:local       # Start localhost-only proxy on :4141
bash scripts/local.sh test:unit         # Run vitest unit tests (no auth/network)
bash scripts/local.sh test:live         # Run live integration tests against M365
```

## Known limitations

- **M365 "disengages" on large tool payloads** — heavy agent harnesses (e.g. opencode's ~15-tool prompt) get empty `Disengaged` responses. Keep the toolset lean (this is why [pi](https://pi.dev/) works well). See [docs/m365-copilot-api.md](docs/m365-copilot-api.md#the-disengaged-filter).
- Tool calling is emulated (prompt injection + a Copilot Studio agent), not native function calling — robust with the agent, unreliable without it
- The `think-deeper` / `*_Reasoning` models take 10-30s per response
- Hard quota of ~600 messages **per conversation** (mitigated by session reuse + delta sends)
- Streaming: **tool-less** responses stream incrementally (deltas forwarded as they arrive). **Tool-calling** turns are still buffered server-side — the raw text has to be parsed for tool-call fences before it can be emitted — so those arrive as a single chunk at the end (with an immediate HTTP 200 + heartbeats so the client never times out waiting)
